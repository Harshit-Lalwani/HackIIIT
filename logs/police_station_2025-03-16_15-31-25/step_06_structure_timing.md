### **Staging Suggestions**
- **Audience Engagement**: Position the audience within the camera's shot for visual feedback. Use their reactions to build comedic timing.
- **Visual Elements**: Use costume changes or props that interact with contestants (e.g., jail bars for comedic effect during spins).
  
By following this structured outline, the sketch will flow naturally, escalating the comedy and providing a satisfying conclusion that engages the audience throughout.
