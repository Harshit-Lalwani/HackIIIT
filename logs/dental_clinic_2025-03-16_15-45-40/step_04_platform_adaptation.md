[adaptor] ### Dental Detective - Adapted for a YouTube Audience

#### Characters:
- **Dr. Gumshoe** (a hyper-dramatic detective/dentist who takes dental mysteries too seriously)
- **Nurse Flossie** (an eccentric nurse with a passion for unconventional dental tools)
- **Patient** (confused and bewildered by the overly dramatic dental staff)

#### Scene:
A dental clinic, dimly lit with noir-style atmosphere. Dr. Gumshoe's office has detective gadgets like magnifying glasses, a rotary phone, and an overhead lamp casting dramatic shadows.

**[The waiting room of the dental clinic. The Patient is sitting nervously, scrolling on their phone. Nurse Flossie enters, inspecting a pair of oversized dental pliers like she's examining a crime scene tool.]**

**Nurse Flossie:** (seriously) Alright, Mr. Smith, Dr. Gumshoe will see you now. (dramatic pause) I trust you’ve been flossing... because he *always* finds out.

**Patient:** (nervous laugh) Uh, yeah, about that...

**Nurse Flossie:** (leans in, whispering conspiratorially) Trying isn’t good enough here, buddy.

**[They enter Dr. Gumshoe's office. Dr. Gumshoe is sitting at his desk, spotlight on him. He’s dressed in a trench coat over his dental uniform, holding a toothpick like a cigar.]**

**Dr. Gumshoe:** (in a gravelly voice) Mr. Smith, I've been expecting you. (spins around in his chair dramatically) Seems we’ve got a serious case of... (pauses for effect) plaque buildup.

**Patient:** (confused) Uh, sure. It’s been a while since my last cleaning.

**Dr. Gumshoe:** (slams magnifying glass on the table) Don’t play coy with me, Smith. This isn’t just an ordinary cleaning. It’s a case of *serial neglect.*

**Nurse Flossie:** (holds up oversized pliers) Should we use Mr. Squeezy?

**Dr. Gumshoe:** (dramatically) Not yet, Flossie. We need more evidence. Mr. Smith, open wide. Wider. WIDER. (peers into the patient's mouth with an oversized magnifying glass) Just as I suspected. The cavity culprit has been here...

**Patient:** (muffled with mouth open) Culprit?

**Dr. Gumshoe:** (nodding) Yes. Sugar, the sweetest assassin. And where there’s sugar, there’s always... cookies.

**Patient:** (trying to talk) I do like cookies...

**Dr. Gumshoe:** Aha! Confession! Flossie, note that down. Confession to cookie consumption. The case is practically cracked.

**Nurse Flossie:** (scribbles in a tiny notepad) So, what's next, Dr. Gumshoe?

**Dr. Gumshoe:** (seriously) Extraction. But not just any extraction. Flossie, bring the... (*dramatically lowers his voice*) ...Mystery Molar Remover.

**Patient:** (alarmed) Mystery what now?

**Nurse Flossie:** (rummages through a drawer and pulls out a comically large, overly complex tool with flashing lights and gears) This beauty. We call it the MMR for short. It’s unorthodox but gets the job done... eventually.

**Patient:** (panicking) I think I just need a filling!

**Dr. Gumshoe:** (leans in close) In this office, we do things the *detective way.* Stay still, this might tickle... or, you know, be traumatizing.

**[Nurse Flossie dramatically turns on the MMR, which makes a series of ridiculous noises. The Patient’s eyes widen in comedic horror as the lights dim further for dramatic effect.]**

**Dr. Gumshoe:** (voiceover) Another case closed at the Gumshoe Clinic. Remember folks, crime doesn’t pay, and neither does skipping out on your dental hygiene.

**[The scene fades out with the sound of the MMR echoing and the Patient’s exaggerated reactions.]**

**End scene.**
