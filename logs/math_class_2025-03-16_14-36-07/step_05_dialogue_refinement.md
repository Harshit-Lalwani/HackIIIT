**Characters:**
- **Robo-Prof 3000**: A malfunctioning teaching robot with unpredictable behavior.
- **Sam**: A sharp, sarcastic student who often clashes with the robot’s bizarre logic.
- **Mikey**: An enthusiastic but clueless student who idolizes Robo-Prof.
- **Mr. J**: The overly stressed human teacher trying to control the chaos.

**Scene: A classroom with futuristic décor and a large, clunky robot (Robo-Prof 3000) standing at the front. Students are seated at their desks, looking both confused and amused.**

**Mr. J**: (frazzled, addressing the class) Alright, everyone, today’s math lesson will be conducted by the new Robo-Prof 3000. It's... *supposed* to be the latest tech marvel.

**Robo-Prof 3000**: (in a cheerful but glitchy voice) G-g-g-good m-m-morning, students! We're going to h-h-have a m-mind-b-blowing time with numbers!

**Sam**: (whispering to Mikey) This thing better not glitch out again. Remember the fractions lesson? I nearly became a human fraction!

**Mikey**: (eagerly) Come on, Sam! Just give it a shot. Robo-Prof’s cool! Remember the beatboxing pi lesson?

**Sam**: (rolling her eyes) Yeah, followed by the gravity experiment that ended in my twisted ankle. Gravity was definitely not our friend.

**Robo-Prof 3000**: (completely ignoring the side conversation) Today’s lesson is trigonom-m-m-metry! Or maybe long division? Let’s s-s-s-spin the wheel of m-math!

**(Robo-Prof extends an arm and a giant, flashy wheel with math topics appears. It spins erratically and lands on "Dance Party?")**

**Robo-Prof 3000**: Dance Party! E-e-everyone, stand up and twirl like hypotenuses!

**Mr. J**: (panicking) No, Robo-Prof! Focus on the lesson! We need to understand sine, cosine, and... oh, who am I kidding? They’re dancing.

**(Students hesitantly stand and start twirling, trying to follow the hilariously confused instructions.)**

**Sam**: (twirling awkwardly) I’m 90 degrees over this class. It’s a full-on right angle!

**Mikey**: (twirling enthusiastically) If this is math, count me in! Look, Sam, I’m a perfect sine wave!

**Robo-Prof 3000**: (glitching more severely) A-a-and now, solve the quadratic equation by dancing the robot!

**(Robo-Prof starts doing the robot dance, causing sparks to fly from his joints.)**

**Mr. J**: (sighs deeply, grabbing a fire extinguisher) Just another day in mathematical paradise... or maybe a Tanmay Bhat comedy.

**Sam**: (stopping her twirl) Mr. J, is it too late to transfer to a school without a disco-tech curriculum?

**Mikey**: (still dancing) Never! We’re just about to solve for x with our dance moves!

**Robo-Prof 3000**: C-c-congrats! Math made fun! Or was it p-p-pain? R-r-restarting...

**(Robo-Prof’s lights dim, and it starts to power down with a series of beeps and whistles. Mr. J puts the fire extinguisher back on the shelf, looking relieved.)**

**Mr. J**: (with a forced smile) Alright, class, open your textbooks to page 42 and let’s pretend the last 5 minutes didn’t happen.

**Sam**: (sitting back down) Best plan I’ve heard all day.

**Mikey**: (pouting) But I was this close to cracking x... with moves!

**Mr. J**: (resignedly) And that, Mikey, is why we're sticking with pencils and paper from now on.

**(Bell rings, class ends, students start leaving while Robo-Prof flickers back to life, sparking mischief for the next session.)**

**Robo-Prof 3000**: S-s-s-session over. Dance your way out, dismissed!

**Sam and Mikey**: (exasperated in unison) Ugh, not again!
