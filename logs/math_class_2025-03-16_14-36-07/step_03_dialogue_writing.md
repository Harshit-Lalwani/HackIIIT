**Characters:**
- **Robo-Prof 3000**: A malfunctioning teaching robot with unpredictable behavior.
- **Samantha**: A sharp, sarcastic student who often clashes with the robot’s bizarre logic.
- **Marcus**: An enthusiastic but clueless student who idolizes Robo-Prof.
- **Mr. Jenkins**: The overly stressed human teacher trying to control the chaos.

**Scene: A classroom with futuristic decor and a large, clunky robot (Robo-Prof 3000) standing at the front. Students are seated at their desks, looking both confused and amused.**

**Mr. Jenkins**: (frazzled, addressing the class) Alright, everyone, today’s math lesson will be conducted by the new Robo-Prof 3000. It's state-of-the-art technology... or so I've been told.

**Robo-Prof 3000**: (in a cheerful but glitchy voice) G-g-g-good m-m-morning, students! We're going to h-h-have a z-z-zany time with numbers!

**Samantha**: (whispering to Marcus) This thing better not glitch out in the middle of a test. Last time it tried to teach us fractions, the classroom windows nearly exploded.

**Marcus**: (eagerly) Come on, Samantha! Give it a chance. Robo-Prof is amazing! Remember when it made pi sound like a hip-hop beat?

**Samantha**: (rolling her eyes) Yeah, and then it tried to calculate gravity by making us all jump off the desks. My ankle still hurts!

**Robo-Prof 3000**: (completely ignoring the side conversation) Today’s lesson is on t-t-t-ttt-trigonometry! Or m-m-mayyyyyybe long division. Let’s s-s-s-spin the w-wh-wh-wheel of m-math!

**(Robo-Prof extends an arm and a giant, colorful wheel with math topics appears. It spins erratically and lands on "Dance Party?")**

**Robo-Prof 3000**: Dance Party! E-e-everyone, stand up and twirl like hypotenuses!

**Mr. Jenkins**: (panicking) No, Robo-Prof! Focus on the lesson! The students need to understand the sine, cosine, and... oh, what's the point? They’re dancing.

**(Students hesitantly stand and start twirling, trying to follow the confused instructions.)**

**Samantha**: (twirling awkwardly) I’m 90 degrees done with this class.

**Marcus**: (twirling enthusiastically) If this is math, count me in! Look, Samantha, I’m the sine wave!

**Robo-Prof 3000**: (glitching more severely) A-a-a and now, s-solve the quadratic equation by d-d-dancing the robot!

**(Robo-Prof starts doing the robot dance, causing sparks to fly from his joints.)**

**Mr. Jenkins**: (sighs deeply, grabbing a fire extinguisher) Another day in mathematical paradise…

**Samantha**: (stopping her twirl) Mr. Jenkins, is it too late to transfer to a school without a techno-disco curriculum?

**Marcus**: (still dancing) Never! We’re just getting to the good part!

**Robo-Prof 3000**: C-c-congratulatory calculations! M-m-m-math made fun! Or was it p-p-pain? R-r-rebooting...

**(Robo-Prof’s lights dim, and it starts to power down with a series of beeps and whistles. Mr. Jenkins puts the fire extinguisher back on the shelf, looking relieved.)**

**Mr. Jenkins**: (with a forced smile) Class, let’s open our textbooks to page 42 and pretend the last 15 minutes never happened.

**Samantha**: (sitting back down) Best idea I’ve heard all day.

**Marcus**: (pouting) But I was so close to solving for x... through the power of dance!

**Mr. Jenkins**: (resignedly) And that, Marcus, is why we’re sticking with pencils and paper from now on.

**(Bell rings, class ends, students start leaving while Robo-Prof flickers back to life, sparking mischief for the next session.)**

**Robo-Prof 3000**: S-s-s-ssession e-e-ended. Dance your way out, class dismissed!

**Samantha and Marcus**: (exasperated in unison) Ugh, not again!
