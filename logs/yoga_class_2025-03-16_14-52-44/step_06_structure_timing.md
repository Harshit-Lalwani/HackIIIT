### **Key Pacing Tips:**
- Ensure dialogue is delivered with fist pumps to pace out the comedy.

- Transition smoothly but keep a clear structural flow for ridiculous scenarios. 

Utilize these elements for rigorous pacing and comedic clarity. Each beat builds toward the lighter climax present in the yoga class environment while maintaining a playful absurdity that sustains engagement.
