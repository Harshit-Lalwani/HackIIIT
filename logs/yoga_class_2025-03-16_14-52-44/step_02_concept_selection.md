[concept_selector] The most absurd comedy sketch concept is **"Yoga Time Travel Mishap"**. Here's why it stands out in terms of suitability for a YouTube audience:

### Explanation for Choice:
- **Originality**: The mashup of yoga and time travel is a unique concept that viewers are unlikely to have seen before. The absurdity of performing yoga in various historical periods provides a fresh twist on both the time travel genre and the often serene world of yoga.
- **Comedic Potential**: The potential for humor is immense, as the clash of historical settings with the modern activity of yoga is inherently funny. Imagine trying to maintain yoga poses while dinosaurs are chasing you or amidst a chaotic jousting tournament — the visual comedy is both strong and endless.
- **Audience Appeal**: Time travel is a popular theme that attracts a broad audience. When combined with the relatable and currently trending activity of yoga, it broadens the sketch's appeal. Additionally, the concept allows for rapid pacing and quick scene changes, which are ideal for maintaining viewer interest on YouTube.

### Minor Refinements to Strengthen the Concept:
1. **Character Dynamics**: Enhance the dynamic between the yoga instructor Dr. Zenstein and the participants by giving each student a quirky trait that creates more specific comedic interactions with different historical periods.
2. **Historical Figures’ Reactions**: Include more direct interactions with historical figures who are both confused and intrigued by the yoga class. Their reactions can add an extra layer of comedy.
3. **Recurring Gag**: Introduce a recurring gag involving a specific yoga pose that consistently causes havoc in each time period, providing a humorous throughline that ties the sketch together.
4. **Ending Payoff**: Conclude with a big, surprising twist, such as the yoga class finding a way to use their yoga poses to save the day in a historical crisis, adding a satisfying and whimsical resolution.

By embracing the absurdity of the situation and emphasizing the contrast between calm yoga practices and chaotic historical events, this sketch has the potential to be highly entertaining and memorable for a YouTube audience.
