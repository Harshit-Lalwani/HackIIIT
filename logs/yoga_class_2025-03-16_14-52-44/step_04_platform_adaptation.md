[adaptor] **Scene: A Stylish Modern Yoga Studio**

**INT. YOGA STUDIO - MORNING**

*The yoga class is about to start. The yoga instructor, DR. ZENSTEIN, enters. He's an eccentric middle-aged man with a partially unbuttoned shirt, a shark tooth necklace, and the strangest part—a smartwatch dangling from his wrist. The students include ERIC, the high-strung overachiever; LUCY, the overly confident yoga newbie; and MRS. HUMPHREYS, the elderly woman who surprisingly excels at every pose.*

**DR. ZENSTEIN**
(Clapping his hands together)
Alright, my yogis! Let’s namaste our way to inner peace and... a bit of historical fun. Ready for a wild ride?

**LUCY**
(A bit confused but excited)
Historical fun? Like a Netflix binge?

**DR. ZENSTEIN**
(Smiling widely)
Oh, much better! Let’s get warmed up with "Downward Dog".

*Everyone gets into Downward Dog pose.*

**ERIC**
(Struggling with the pose)
If this doesn’t calm me down, I’m going back to CrossFit.

**MRS. HUMPHREYS**
(Perfectly poised)
It gets easier with time, dear... though something tells me we might not have much of it.

**LUCY**
(With a chuckle)
I see what you did there.

**DR. ZENSTEIN**
(Tapping his smartwatch)
And I see we’re ready! Clasp your hands and breathe deep... as we transcend time!

*DR. ZENSTEIN presses a button on the smartwatch. The room spins, lights flash, and they suddenly find themselves in a prehistoric jungle.*

**LUCY**
(Gasping)
Oh my god, are we in Jurassic Park!?

**ERIC**
(Panicking)
Is that a T-Rex? Seriously, Zenstein?!

**DR. ZENSTEIN**
(Calmly)
Stay centered, everyone. We’re just doing the "Mountain Pose".

**MRS. HUMPHREYS**
(Unaffected)
Mountain Pose? More like the "don’t-get-eaten-by-a-dinosaur" pose.

*They all hold the Mountain Pose awkwardly as dinosaurs roar in the background. The T-Rex approaches but gets distracted by something noisier.*

**DR. ZENSTEIN**
(Smiling)
See, it's all about finding your inner tranquility.

*The scene shifts again, lights spin, and they find themselves in medieval times, right in the middle of a jousting tournament.*

**ERIC**
(Ducking as a knight charges past him)
Zenstein, some heads up next time!

**DR. ZENSTEIN**
(Laughing)
And miss the surprise element? Quick! Child’s Pose!

*They all drop to the Child’s Pose as knights fight around them, one knight stumbling over ERIC’s feet.*

**MRS. HUMPHREYS**
(Still outperforming everyone)
At least they’re polite enough not to step on us. 

**LUCY**
(Looking at the knights)
Wait, are they bowing to us?

**DR. ZENSTEIN**
(Laughing)
They think we're mystical monks. Everyone, Tree Pose!

*The students rise into Tree Pose, trying not to get hit by knights or laugh at the absurdity.*

**DR. ZENSTEIN**
(Satisfied)
Beautiful! And now, Warrior II!

**ERIC**
(Struggling)
Did they have T-Rex’s during medieva—nevermind.

*Time spins again—they’re in Ancient Rome, surrounded by togas in front of a large Colosseum crowd.*

**DR. ZENSTEIN**
(Beaming)
Ah, Rome! Such history. Warrior III pose!

*They all comply, balancing and shaking. A Roman Emperor raises an eyebrow from his seat.*

**LUCY**
(Whispering)
How long are we doing this?

**DR. ZENSTEIN**
(Whispering back)
Until the lions are fed… kidding. Annnd Breathe!

*Time spins again, they’re back in the yoga studio, looking bewildered but amused. Everyone collapses onto their mats.*

**ERIC**
(Breathless)
That was... kind of amazing...

**MRS. HUMPHREYS**
(Smiling)
Better than bingo night.

**LUCY**
(Excitedly)
So, ninjas next class?

**DR. ZENSTEIN**
(With a mischievous grin)
You'll just have to come back and see. Namaste, everyone.

**ALL**
(Laughing softly)
Namaste.

*FADE OUT.*
