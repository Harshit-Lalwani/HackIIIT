[concept_selector] ### Selected Concept: "The Literal Yoga Class"

**Rationale:**
"The Literal Yoga Class" stands out as the most absurd and has the greatest potential to captivate a YouTube audience due to its sheer ridiculousness and its clear, visual comedic cues. Here's why it is the most suitable:

1. **Premise Originality**:
   - The concept of a literal-minded instructor misinterpreting yoga poses brings a fresh, unique take to the genre of yoga comedy sketches.
 
2. **Visual Comedic Potential**:
   - The literal interpretations of phrases like "downward dog" and "child's pose" can lead to highly visual and easily understandable humor, making it accessible and engaging for a broad audience.
   - The potential for exaggerated physical comedy is high, which can be particularly effective in retaining viewers' attention on a platform like YouTube.

3. **Character Dynamics**:
   - The diverse personalities of the characters (Ms. Literal, class clown Jake, novice Sophia, etc.) allow for a variety of comedic interactions and misunderstandings, which can keep the audience entertained throughout the sketch.

4. **Audience Appeal**:
   - Miscommunications and misunderstandings are universally relatable and timeless comedic elements that resonate with a wide audience.
   - The absurdity of the situation is likely to generate shares and discussions, aiding in the sketch's viral potential.

### Refinements:
1. **Diverse Phrases and Instructions**:
   - Include a wider range of yoga terms and instructions for Ms. Literal to misinterpret. This can introduce new layers of humor and keep the sketch dynamic. Examples could be interpretations of "cobra pose," "warrior pose," or "tree pose."

2. **Heightened Physicality**:
   - Emphasize physical comedy by exaggerating the movements and behaviors of the students as they attempt to follow the literal instructions. Think slapstick elements or over-the-top physical reactions.

3. **A Build-Up to a Climax**:
   - Structure the sketch to build up to a climactic, chaotic scene where all misunderstandings culminate in an extremely absurd, laugh-out-loud scenario. This could involve a culminating event where multiple literal directives overlap, resulting in hilarious mayhem.

4. **Supportive Props and Costumes**:
   - Use props and costumes to enhance literal interpretations. For instance, students could have to wear dog ears for "downward dog" or bring in childlike accessories for "childâ€™s pose."

By refining these elements, "The Literal Yoga Class" can leverage its absurd core concept to deliver maximum comedic impact, making it a strong candidate for a YouTube sketch.
