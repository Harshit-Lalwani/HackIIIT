### "The Literal Yoga Class" - YouTube Adaptation

**Setting:** A cozy, well-lit yoga studio with yoga mats and some quirky decor. The usual yoga props like blocks and straps are scattered around. A clock on the wall shows the time as 5 PM, and there's a large window with the view of a calming garden.

**Characters:**
- **Ms. Literal (Instructor):** Firm, with a passion for literal interpretations.
- **Jake:** The joker, always ready to bring humor.
- **Sophia:** A rookie, eager and nervous.
- **Karen:** An experienced yogi, puzzled by the new teacher.

**Ms. Literal** (clapping hands enthusiastically): Welcome, everyone! Let's dive straight into some literal interpretations of yoga.

**Sophia** (whispering to Jake): Is she for real?

**Jake** (grinning): Oh, this is gonna be a blast. [NEW JOKE] Watch and learn, grasshopper.

**Ms. Literal**: We'll start with the "downward dog." But remember, we're literal here. Be the dog.

**Jake** (clinching): Oh, I've got this! (Pulls out dog ears from his bag, puts them on, and starts barking on all fours)

**Ms. Literal** (nodding): That’s it, Jake! Excellent form.

**Sophia** (raising her hand): Ms. Literal, how do we do the "child's pose" literally?

**Ms. Literal**: Embrace your inner child. 

**Jake** (lying on his back, thumbs in mouth): Just like this! [ENHANCED PUNCHLINE]

**Ms. Literal**: Perfect! Let's move to "cobra pose."

**Sophia**: Should we act like snakes?

**Jake** (dropping flat, hissing): Sssss! Let’s get slithery. [NEW JOKE]

**Karen** (to Sophia): Is this yoga or animal antics?

**Ms. Literal**: Great energy! Now, slither a bit more for full effect.

**Jake** (slithering): I hope there are no mongoose poses. [NEW JOKE]

**Sophia**: I’m ready for "tree pose!"

**Ms. Literal**: Yes! Find your spot and... be a tree.

(Karen does a traditional tree pose, while Jake stands by a potted plant, pretending to root)

**Jake**: Someone, water me! I'm a thirsty tree. 

**Sophia** (to Karen): This is bizarre but kinda fun.

**Karen**: Totally. And kinda hilarious.

**Ms. Literal**: Excellent commitment! [NEW JOKE] If you start growing apples, let me know.

**Jake**: Ready for the "warrior pose!"

**Ms. Literal**: Yes! Find your inner warrior.

**Sophia**: Let me guess. He’s bringing out props.

**Jake** (whipping out a toy sword and shield): Ready for battle! [RUNNING GAG CONTINUED]

**Ms. Literal**: True warrior spirit!

**Karen** (facepalming, laughing): Literal yoga chaos.

(as Sophia, Karen, and others laugh, Jake leads an imaginary charge)

**Ms. Literal**: And that's class! Remember, there's no wrong way to do yoga... or life. And don’t forget to water your inner tree. [CALLBACK]

**Jake** (still in his warrior pose): Now, who’s up for the "corpse pose?" I brought a ghost sheet. [RUNNING GAG CONCLUDED]
