**[The bell rings, signaling the start of class. Students saunter in, chatting and taking their seats. Mrs. Thornton stands at the front with a stack of scripts.]**

**Mrs. Thornton**: (clapping her hands) Alright, class, settle down! Today we’re doing something exceptionally exciting! 

**Tyler**: (leans back, smirking) Does that mean we don't have to read more about people talking funny and dying?

**Jessica**: (bouncing in her seat) Oh, Tyler, you’re going to love this! We’re combining Shakespeare with superheroes!

**Mrs. Thornton**: (beaming) That’s right, Jessica! We’re putting on a play titled "Shakespearean Superheroes." Think Hamlet meets the Avengers!

**Riley**: (raising an eyebrow) Wait, so does that mean Romeo and Juliet are gonna team up to fight crime or something?

**Mrs. Thornton**: (giggles) Not exactly, Riley. Each Shakespearean character will have a unique superpower. For example, Hamlet will have the power to communicate with ghosts.

**Tyler**: (sarcastic) Oh great, emo kid with ghost dad. That's gonna be a hit.

**Emma**: (dramatically) Oh, the tragic depth! To speak with the otherworldly... It's like Shakespeare was meant for this!

**Liam**: (innocently) So, does that mean Lady Macbeth is basically a mind-controlling supervillain?

**Mrs. Thornton**: (winks) Exactly, Liam! And Macbeth himself will have super strength—until Lady Macbeth messes with his mind!

**Jessica**: (leaning forward) And we’ll have battle scenes! With soliloquies! Imagine Hamlet going, “To be, or not to be—POW!” (mimics a punch) Right in Claudius’s face!

**Tyler**: (pretending to be serious) Yeah, but where’s my superpower? Can I just be the guy who naps in the background and occasionally gets up to make sarcastic comments?

**Mrs. Thornton**: (laughing) We'll find a role for you, Tyler. Maybe King Lear with the power to control the weather... for better or worse.

**Riley**: (skeptical) And how are we planning to pull this off with, you know, zero budget and homemade costumes?

**Jessica**: (excitedly) Oh, I’ve got it all planned out! Cardboard shields, paper mache crowns, and capes from thrift stores! It’ll be authentic... sort of.

**Emma**: (dreamily) Yes, it’s the spirit of the theatre! Imagination over budget!

**Liam**: (deadpan) Nothing more terrifying than a superhero with a tinfoil sword.

**Mrs. Thornton**: (smiling) Exactly, Liam! It’s about creativity and making Shakespeare fun and memorable. Now everyone, let’s grab a script and start rehearsing our lines. To infinity and Bard’s verse!

**Tyler**: (muttering) More like "To confusion and beyond!"

**[The students laugh as they pick up scripts, starting to read through their lines and imagine their absurd new roles. The sketch starts to build the hilarious world of "Shakespearean Superheroes" as each character’s superpower and personality contrast lead to comedic situations.]**
