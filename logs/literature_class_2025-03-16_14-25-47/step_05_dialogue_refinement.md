**Mrs. Thornton**: (clapping her hands) Alright, class! Eyes up front! We’re diving into something unbelievably cool today!

**[Close-up of Tyler, reclining in his chair, smirking.]**

**Tyler**: Finally, a break from old dead dudes with funny accents.

**[Cut to Jessica, practically bouncing in her seat.]**

**Jessica**: Oh, Tyler, you’re gonna love this! Shakespeare meets superheroes!

**[Mrs. Thornton beams with pride.]**

**Mrs. Thornton**: Right, Jessica! We’re putting on "Shakespearean Superheroes!" Imagine Hamlet as Iron Man!

**[Riley raises an eyebrow skeptically.]**

**Riley**: So, Romeo and Juliet become crime fighters now?

**Mrs. Thornton**: Not quite, Riley. They get superpowers! Like Hamlet talking to ghosts… with a twist.

**[Cut to Tyler, sarcastically intrigued.]**

**Tyler**: Awesome. Emo kid with a ghost dad. Sure to be a blockbuster.

**[Emma, dramatically, in pure theatrics mode.]**

**Emma**: Oh, the drama! Conversing with spirits... It's like Shakespeare was born for superheroes!

**[Liam, quietly making a witty comment.]**

**Liam**: So, Lady Macbeth’s a mind-controlling supervillain now?

**[Mrs. Thornton winks at him.]**

**Mrs. Thornton**: Exactly, Liam! And Macbeth has super strength… until Lady Macbeth gets in his head.

**[Jessica leans in, excitement radiating.]**

**Jessica**: With epic fight scenes and powerful soliloquies! Imagine, Hamlet saying “To be, or not to be—POW!” Right in Claudius’s face!

**[Tyler, pretending to be serious.]**

**Tyler**: Can I be the guy who naps and makes sarcastic comments?

**[Mrs. Thornton chuckles.]**

**Mrs. Thornton**: Maybe King Lear with weather control... unpredictably grumpy!

**[Riley, still skeptical.]**

**Riley**: And how exactly are we doing this on a zero budget?

**[Jessica, with boundless enthusiasm.]**

**Jessica**: Cardboard shields, paper mache crowns, thrift shop capes! Super authentic… kinda.

**[Emma, dreamily.]**

**Emma**: It’s all about the magic of theatre! Creativity over cost!

**[Liam, deadpan.]**

**Liam**: Nothing scarier than a superhero with a tinfoil sword.

**[Mrs. Thornton, with unwavering optimism.]**

**Mrs. Thornton**: Exactly, Liam! It's about creativity and keeping Shakespeare fun. Grab a script, everyone! To infinity and Bard’s verse!

**Tyler**: (muttering) More like "To confusion and beyond..."
