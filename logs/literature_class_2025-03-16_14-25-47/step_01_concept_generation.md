[concept_generator] ### Sketch Concept 1: "Shakespearean Superheroes"

**Premise:**
In a high school literature class, students are required to create modern adaptations of Shakespearean characters. However, one overly enthusiastic student insists on turning these classic characters into superheroes, complete with powers and costumes.

**Key Characters:**
- **Mr. Thompson:** The mild-mannered literature teacher who struggles to keep the class on track.
- **Jessica:** The overzealous student with a wild imagination who spearheads the superhero concept.
- **Mark:** The skeptical classmate who constantly questions the logic of medieval superheroes.
- **Emily:** The class overachiever who tries to maintain the integrity of Shakespearean dialogue while embracing the superhero theme.

**Central Comedic Tension:**
The tension arises as Jessica's over-the-top ideas clash with Mr. Thompson's attempts to teach actual literary analysis. The hilarity peaks when the class stages an outrageous play featuring "Hamlet: The Avenger," "Macbeth: The Dark Knight," and "Titus Andronicus: The Deadpool."

### Sketch Concept 2: "The Substitute"

**Premise:**
A substitute teacher, who thinks he is teaching a different subject every class, leads a literature class through various wild interpretations of classic literature, much to the class's bewilderment and amusement.

**Key Characters:**
- **Mr. Jenkins:** The absent-minded substitute teacher who hilariously misinterprets the subject matter.
- **Ashley:** The class's unofficial leader who tries to steer Mr. Jenkins back on track.
- **Ryan:** The class clown who enjoys the chaos and further fuels Mr. Jenkins' confusion.
- **Sophie:** The quiet student who surprisingly knows every subject Mr. Jenkins brings up.

**Central Comedic Tension:**
The comedic tension comes from Mr. Jenkins teaching a new, completely unrelated subject each class, such as turning "Moby Dick" into a story about the stock market, or analyzing "Pride and Prejudice" as if it were a horror novel. The students' reactions and their attempts to keep him grounded create constant comedy.

### Sketch Concept 3: "The Literary Time Machine"

**Premise:**
A high school literature class accidentally sends their teacher back in time with an experimental time machine they built as part of a science fair project. The students must navigate their way through the literature curriculum while trying to retrieve their stranded teacher from various literary periods.

**Key Characters:**
- **Mr. Lopez:** The teacher with a passion for literature who suddenly finds himself meeting the authors he’s been teaching about.
- **Dylan:** The science whiz student who built the time machine and is now leading the rescue mission.
- **Chloe:** The literature enthusiast who uses her knowledge to help communicate with historical figures.
- **Jake:** The prankster student who sees this as an opportunity for endless shenanigans.

**Central Comedic Tension:**
The comedic tension comes from the students attempting to replace their missing teacher while keeping their time-travel antics a secret. Meanwhile, Mr. Lopez's misadventures in history — such as trying to explain modern education to Shakespeare or Dickens — provide humorous historical mashups.
