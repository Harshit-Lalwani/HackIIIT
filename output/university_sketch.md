**[Scene opens in a university library, where Kevin is setting up a meticulously organized study station.]**

**Kevin**: (checking his watch) Alright, people, we have exactly 120 minutes to conquer this material. I’ve color-coded the flashcards and created a detailed schedule. Let’s stay focused!

**Samantha**: (saunters in with a latte) Oh, speaking of focus, did you hear about the llama that escaped from the petting zoo? Priceless!

**Kevin**: (sighs) Not now, Samantha. Eyes on the prize.

**Julian**: (arrives with a pillow) Hey guys, I’m here! Just gonna take a quick power nap. You know, to absorb the information.

**Kevin**: (exasperated) Julian, you can’t learn by osmosis! This isn’t a science experiment.

**Mia**: (enters with VR goggles) Chill, Kevin. I’ve got this new VR app that supposedly makes studying as engaging as Fortnite. It’s revolutionary.

**Kevin**: (determined) Alright, let’s get started. Samantha, can you summarize Chapter 3?

**Samantha**: Sure! So, there’s this thing about... (distracted by her phone) Wait, did you see that meme? It’s a cat dressed as a pirate! 

**Kevin**: (facepalms) Focus! Please!

**Julian**: (laying on the floor) I’m focusing...on my dreams.

**Mia**: (lights dim and VR headset turns on) Whoa, it’s like I’m inside the textbook. Look, there’s the Pythagorean theorem floating right in front of me!

**Kevin**: (mutters) This is going to be a long study session.

**[45 minutes later, Kevin is frantically trying to keep everyone on track.]**

**Kevin**: Alright, next topic—logarithms. Samantha, logarithms?

**Samantha**: (now coloring a unicorn) Oh, right! Logs are, like, the math equivalent of tree rings, right?

**Kevin**: (shaking his head) No, no, no! Julian, wake up! We need you to answer the next question.

**Julian**: (wakes up confused) Uh, what’s the question? More importantly, why is my pillow missing?

**Mia**: (in VR world) It’s like Hogwarts in here, but for algebra!

**Kevin**: (on the verge of a breakdown) Alright, everyone, let’s try a team-building exercise. Trust falls, maybe?

**Samantha**: (enthusiastically) Ooh, trust falls! I saw a YouTube tutorial about that. So funny when it goes wrong!

**Kevin**: (losing hope) This isn’t supposed to be funny, Samantha! (deep breath) Okay, how about a quick quiz?

**Mia**: (VR headset off) Kevin, calm down. Here, try the VR headset. It’s kinda fun.

**Kevin**: (puts on headset, sarcastically) Great, now I’m in a virtual world of equations... (looks around, impressed) Actually, this is kinda cool.

**Samantha**: (snickering) Hey, Kevin. In that world, is there a way to mute your stress levels?

**Julian**: And maybe learn by taking micro-naps?

**Kevin**: (laughs despite himself) Alright, maybe we can try it your way. But if we fail, I’m blaming all of you.

**[Scene ends with the group laughing and Kevin finally relaxing, albeit briefly. There's a quick cut to them all asleep amongst textbooks.]**

**Mia**: (in a sleepy mumble) At least we tried…

**Kevin**: (wakes up briefly) Maybe osmosis does work...
