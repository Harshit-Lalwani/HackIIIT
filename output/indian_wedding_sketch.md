**Scene 1: The Baraat Takes a Wrong Turn**

*The baraat music is blaring, everyone is dancing, and the baraat makes a turn into a dead-end alley.*

**Vikram:** (shouting over the music) Hey Sanjay, why did we stop? Wrong way?

**Sanjay:** (confidently) No, no, my Google Maps says it’s a shortcut!

**Auntie 1:** (waving her phone) Beta, I think we are lost. My Candy Crush is giving me better directions than Sanjay bhaiya!

**Uncle 1:** (looking around) I think I saw this place in "Slumdog Millionaire." Is this part of the wedding package?

---

**Scene 2: Asking the Auto-Wallah**

*They spot an auto-wallah and Vikram approaches him with Sanjay.*

**Vikram:** Bhaiya, can you guide us to Ascot Gardens?

**Auto-Wallah:** (scratching head) Arrey, Ascot Gardens? Yaad toh hai... ah yes, turn left at the big pile of garbage, then right at the samosa stall, and somewhere in between, you'll find it!

**Sanjay:** (to Vikram) See, I knew we were close!

**Auto-Wallah:** (grinning) Of course, if you see the river, you’ve gone too far. Or not far enough, who knows?

---

**Scene 3: Entering a Small Market**

*The baraat enters a bustling market by mistake and attracts confused looks from shopkeepers.*

**Local Shopkeeper:** (yelling) Shaadi hai ya reality TV show ka shoot? You're blocking my customers!

**Vikram:** Bhai-sahab, how do we get to Ascot Gardens?

**Local Shopkeeper:** (thoughtful) Hmm, depends. Looking for directions or a good deal on two-for-one Mangal Sutras?

**Auntie 2:** (groaning) I just need directions! The mehndi on my hands is drying out.

**Shopkeeper:** (handing over a bag) Here, take some jalebis for the road. Keep everyone sweet—especially the bride, haan?

---

**Scene 4: The Baraat Turns into a Dance Party**

*The baraatis, stressed but still cheerful, turn up the music and start dancing again in the streets.*

**Uncle 2:** (dancing) Even if we're lost, at least we are having the best baraat! Who needs GPS when you have a DJ?

**Vikram:** (laughing) Or when you have Sanjay, who somehow still thinks Pluto is a planet!

**Sanjay:** (dancing) Hey! It WAS a planet when I failed Geography!

---

**Scene 5: Last Chance Directions**

*They finally encounter an elderly man sitting outside a tea stall, reading a newspaper.*

**Vikram:** (panting) Uncleji, Ascot Gardens?

**Elderly Man:** Ah, youngsters. It's right behind you. Simple U-turn, beta. 

**Baraatis:** (collective facepalm)

**Vikram:** (to Sanjay) That's it. You're not planning the honeymoon.

*The baraat finally makes a U-turn and heads to the wedding venue, the band resumes, and everyone dances with renewed energy.*

**Callbacks:**

During the wedding:

**Priya:** (to Vikram) So, how was the baraat?

**Vikram:** Let's just say, next time, we'll just use pigeons.

**Sanjay:** (with jalebis) At least we got free snacks!

**Vikram:** (groaning) And a new reality TV show idea.

### Performance Pacing Guidance:

1. **Intros (0:00-0:15):** Start strong with high energy; engage the audience with bold characterizations.
2. **Escalation Beats (0:15-1:35):** Maintain a brisk pace. Use overlapping dialogue and body language to heighten the comedy during confusions and misunderstandings. Let reactions linger just long enough for the audience to absorb the humor.
3. **Climax & Resolution (1:35-2:00):** Cut to the punchline quickly. The turn to the elderly man should be met with a sudden stop in the music for comedic effect. Wrap up with quick-paced banter that reflects the personalities of the characters.

By following this structure, the sketch will build up comedic tension, providing a satisfying and humorous climax while engaging the audience throughout.
